# WebPlayerAJ 

Created by Antoni Jankowski.

## Why?

This little project is a simple use of hls.js library. It's part of the Multimedia Information Processing and Communications class at AGH University.

## How to launch the WebPlayerAJ?

I recommend using simple python server to display the project.
It's enough for the purpose and It's the one I use.

```sh
python3 -m http.server
```
